(Optional) What was your favorite part of the assignment?
My favorite part of the assignment was implementing the payroll calculation logic. 
It was interesting to design a system that accurately computes salaries based on different employee types, 
working hours, and deductions.

(Optional) How would you improve the assignment?

To improve the assignment, I would suggest adding more real-world complexities, 
such as tax calculations, overtime pay, or benefits deductions, to make it more practical. 
Additionally, implementing a database for storing employee records instead of using 
in-memory data structures would enhance scalability. I
improving the user interface, such as adding a simple command-line or GUI interaction, 
could also make the system more user-friendly. 
Lastly, providing clearer requirements or edge case scenarios in the assignment 
prompt would help students better understand the expected outcomes.
