(Optional) What was your favorite part of the assignment?
My favorite part of this aaignment is to write a wrong test and then debug for it again and again and again,lol. However I finally realized that my rest code was wrong, then I pass all of the test.


(Optional) How would you improve the assignment?
I think the most important thing to improve the assignment is to make sure the test parts are correct, if I set a wrong base tone, then  I will get a wrong result.
